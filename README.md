##Arslantepe Project
Data analysis of simulation files for Arslantepe plain. 
Arslantepe is located in Malatya province of eastern Turkey. The Italian Arslantepe Archaeological Mission has been carrying out excavations and survey at and around the site for more than five decades. Thirty-meter tall mound covers approximately 4 hectares and contains eight levels that span from the Late Chalcolithic. Arslantepe is well known for its Hittite (Late Bronze Age, ca. 3700 cal. BP) and the Neo-Hittite (Iron Age) phases due to extensive textual evidence, however the discoveries in the last couple of decades suggest that the site was a major hub especially in the Late Chalcolithic (ca. 5300â€“4950 cal. BP) as result of the Uruk expansion from southern Mesopotamia (Restelli 2012; Frangipane 2010a). 

###Arslantepe simulations
The simulations are run by MML (MedlanD Modeling Laboratory) program for 27 scenarios. Each scenario had 20 realisations to make simulations statistically significant.  And maps are made in GRASS GIS program and graphs/analysis are made in R (ggplot2)
